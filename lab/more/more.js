  - Favor async/await over promises

  - Fetch a set of breweries (all breweries with 'cat' in their name)
  - Fetch information about each brewery
  - Make the fetch fail (but not the entire program) e.g requesting a brewery that doesn't exits.
  - Use deconstructing to extract city, state and website url
  - Print the the city, state and website url

  - Favor async/await over promises

  - Fetch a set of users (with a specific nationality)
  - Make the fetch fail (but not the entire program) if the nationality code does not match the requested on (i.e. use 'SE' which isn't supported)
  - Use destructuring to extract at least (name, city, state and nationality)
  - Pretty print the name, city, state and nationality.
